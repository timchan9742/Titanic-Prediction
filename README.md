# Titanic Survival Prediction

This project aims to predict the survival of passengers aboard the Titanic using the Random Forest algorithm. 

## Dataset

The Titanic dataset, available on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/yasserh/titanic-dataset), contains information about passengers such as their age, gender, ticket class, fare, cabin, and whether they survived or not.

## Results

The best model achieved an accuracy of 83% on the test set using the Random Forest algorithm with cross-validation.
